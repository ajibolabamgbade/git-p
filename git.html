    				Git is a system software, it is a distributed version-control system that helps you and your team track changes in codes during a software development project. It is also designed to help programmers coordinate their works among themselves. Git is used to track changes in any set of files.

Git will help you get your project completed effectively and efficiently and you can as well recall specific versions later.
As a graphic or web designer it will help you revert selected files back to previous state or the entire project to it's previous state and you can also compare changes over time and monitor who made changes, when changes were made that could be causing issues or who introduced an issue and when it was introduced.
Version-control allows you to recover all files whether by loss of device or damage and you get this without headache.

Git is a saver and better way. It helps you get rid of incredible errors that can be caused by Local Version Control Systems, Central Version control Systems and Distribution version Control Systems which makes developers easily forget which directory they are in and could mistakenly write to wrong files, some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure, and doesn't allow your workflows to have centralised systems, such as hierarchical models respectively.
